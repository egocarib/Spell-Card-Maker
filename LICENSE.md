## Graphic design and concept

Spell card design concepts, layout, and images originally created and arranged
by [NBeebz][1]. NBeebz' original license and attribution statements follow:

> These cards (and the icons and images used in them) are licensed under the
[Creative Commons License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)][2]. You are free to modify and

Icons all came from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/)
<br>• [Joss Stick][3] by Hea Poh Lin (ritual indicator)
<br>• [Speech][4] by Edward Boatman (verbal component)
<br>• [Zoom In][5] by Mungang Kim (somatic component)
<br>• [Pouch][6] by Hea Poh Lin (material component)
<br>• [Brain][7] by Linda Yuki Nakanishi (concentration indicator)
<br><br>
The spell school circles and card back image both came from talented DeviantArt
users:
<br>• [The Arcane Arts][8] by Icrangirl
<br>• [Dungeon's and Dragons Wallpaper][9] by Xabian
<br><br>
And of course I have to thank my lovely fiance for helping me edit the cards and
giving me lots of design advice.
